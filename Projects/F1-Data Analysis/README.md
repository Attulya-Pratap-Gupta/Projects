## F1 DATA ANALYSIS

OBJECTIVES : 
The project aims to answer the following questions:
1. Exploring the relationship between Starting Grid position and the Final race position
2. Identifying the most dangerous track in Formula 1 racing
3. Identifying the driver who lead most laps in F-1
4. Identifying the fastest lap time recorded for each track and who set the fastest time
5. Analyzing the difference between the lap times from the Early Era and the Hybrid Era

METHODOLOGY
The methodology used to conduct this analysis included combining the scattered data in different csv files into a coherent dataframe. The task involved:
* Loading all the available csv files into the Jupyter notebook. 
* Filtering and Formatiing all the sub-dataframes available. 
* Displaying the header for each sub-dataframe to get an idea of the dataset
* Creating a final dataframe to work on by merging the sub-dataframes
* Removing the redundant values in the datafrmae and dropping unnecessary columns
* Dropping Na values 
* Sorting the dataframe and changing the datatype of required columns according to the need
* Data Visualization to draw conclusions

INSTRUCTIONS
1. To run the Jupyter Notebook place all the csv files in the same folder as the notebook
2. Install the necessary Python packages: pandas, numpy, scipy, seaborn, matplotlib
